When you're stuck on a project, or in your patterns, sometimes questions are useful.

We call this stone-skipping. Take the question, and see what parts of you it touches. Write down what comes up. Play with the concepts. Shift your patterns, get new ideas, discover a new approach to that stuck project.

It's like reprogramming for the brain.
