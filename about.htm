    <h2>About Stone Skipping</h2>
    <p>Stone Skipping is a technique for working on your patterns. The ones that live in your head.</p>
    <p>Ask a question and write down your answer. The best stone-skipping questions are open-ended, and help you to think about your patterns in a compassionate, non-judgemental way.</p>

    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm Lucy McLaughlin. Among various other things, I'm a programmer, and a student of <a href="http://fluentself.com">Havi</a>.</p>
    <p>One day, working through some stuff, and not owning any of the lovely cards Havi makes, I decided to write a small program to take some questions and randomise them.</p>
    <h2>About the Randomiser</h2>
    <p>This is that program, slightly adapted to work through a browser. The idea is simple: you simply enter the number of questions you would like to answer into the <a href="index.htm">stone skipper</a> and receive that number of random questions.</p>
